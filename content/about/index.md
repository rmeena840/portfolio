Hello! I'm Ravindra Meena, from Mumbai, also known as Finance capital of India.

I have completed my Bachelors from [IIT Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/) in Computer Science and Engineering (2015-2019).

I am also a GSoCer 2019 [GSoC RTEMS Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6270870320840704/) by Google.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
